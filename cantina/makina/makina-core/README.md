# Makina Core Smart Contracts

This repository contains the core smart contracts of the Makina Protocol.

## Background

Makina is a protocol for executing advanced cross-chain investment strategies. It provides the infrastructure for operators to issue tokenized strategies with full DeFi composability and strong risk controls. At the core of each strategy is a Machine contract, on the Hub Chain, which handles deposits, withdrawals, share pricing, and cross-chain coordination. Execution across chains is performed by Calibers, which serve as the strategyâ€™s execution engines across the Hub and and all supported Spoke Chains. Every strategy is defined by a Mandate that outlines its objectives, risk profile, and operating parameters, serving as a reference for the operator, risk managers, the Security Council, and the DAO.

See `SPECIFICATION.md` and `PERMISSIONS.MD` for more details.

| `SwapModule.sol`            | Hub + Spoke      | Standalone module used by calibers to execute swap transactions through external protocols.                                                         |
| `AcrossV3BridgeAdapter.sol` | Hub + Spoke      | Handles bidirectional bridge transfers via Across V3, between a hub machine and a spoke caliber. Operates with a counterpart on the opposite chain. |

## Installation

Follow [this link](https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation) to install the Foundry toolchain.

## Submodules

Run below command to include/update all git submodules like forge-std, openzeppelin contracts etc (`lib/`)

```shell
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

## Dependencies

Run below command to include project dependencies like prettier and solhint (`node_modules/`)

```shell
yarn
```

### Build

Run below command to compile contracts that require IR-based codegen (`src-ir/` and `test-ir/`)

```shell
yarn build:ir
```

Run below command to compile all other contracts

```shell
forge build
```

### Test

Some tests involve network forking. To run them, the `MAINNET_RPC_URL` and `BASE_RPC_URL` variables must be set in a .env file located at the project root.

Some tests also execute JavaScript scripts for Merkle root generation. These require Node.js v18 or later.

```shell
forge test
```

```shell
yarn coverage
```

### Format

```shell
forge fmt
```

### Lint
