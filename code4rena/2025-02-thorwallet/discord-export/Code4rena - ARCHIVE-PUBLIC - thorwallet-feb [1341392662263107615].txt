@cryptoxz (Thorwallet) the bridging and withdrawal of TITN. Is this a one time event? Or will this be continously held


[02/20/2025 22:16] cd_pandora
@Matt


[02/20/2025 22:37] cacaomatt
It's intended to be a 1 time event for users. Although they can also do it several times. The goal is that within the 1 year period where the contract will allow merging most TGT holders will go through this process.

Hey!
on the image - it is supposed to be npm install no?

Please is there a pool allocation for low findings?

Hi there! That's a c4 question, not a sponsor question. Would you mind removing the tag, please?

I'm linking the RSVP which has the pool breakdown.

@Matt @cryptoxz (Thorwallet)  does the owner is trusted


[02/21/2025 13:31] cryptoxz
Owner of merge contract and deployed of both token is us. Not sure what do you mean here


[02/21/2025 13:32] no.one7777
`onlyOwner`


[02/21/2025 13:33] cryptoxz
I don‚Äôt get what you mean by trusted


[02/21/2025 13:34] __serverless
Since they are the owners, yes, it should be trusted.

what does this mean?


[02/21/2025 14:23] cacaomatt (pinned)
There is one trusted role and it‚Äôs the owner (deployer)


[02/21/2025 14:27] 0x46_dustin
but that's not in the readme.

wanna explain about it, @kartoonjoy | C4üéáüéá


[02/21/2025 14:44] kartoonjoy
is the ask here that the trusted role be designated as the owner in the README?


[02/21/2025 14:45] 0x46_dustin
trusted role is N/A in the readme.


[02/21/2025 14:46] msk0333
i think that is mistake. the owner should be trusted

who is the address `_delegate` in the constructor of the `Titn` contract?

I think we can assume them to be the owner as the minter is trusted anyways.

am I wrong?


[02/21/2025 18:47] samuselderg
I dont have full context, but skimming the audit repo seems the audit is for the bridge between tokens, so i would expect TGT at least to already exist on mainnet


[02/21/2025 18:53] cacaomatt
These are all test deployments.
The only contract that already exists (for several years now) is TGT


[02/21/2025 18:54] cacaomatt
The audit is for the TITN contracts (including the bridge mechanism) and the Merge contract

Please has anyone been able to deploy the Titn contract?

I'm running into some issues here


[02/22/2025 09:43] cacaomatt
Did you try `npx hardhat lz:deploy` > select both base and arbitrum > then type `Titn`


[02/22/2025 10:10] ochuko_wh.
Okay, but is it possible to do the foundry method?


[02/22/2025 10:12] cacaomatt
that's out of scope in this codebase

Yes, If no issues found, all 3 contracts will be redeployed

I was thinking 799 submission is too much but there is 1250 warden in this group if only 160 of us report 5 submission it will be the 800 submission but the pot prize of 18,000 is too low


[02/27/2025 18:58] horus1_007
how much time it will take 2 weeks or 3 weeks or 1 month what is the typical range time??


[02/27/2025 19:24] ykuio
There were 5?


[02/27/2025 21:25] horus1_007
the judges of this contract is the best people in the web3 security

799?? You gotta be kidding me, spent the whole duration of it, didn't saw of a bug-like in the code base and y'll be submitting 799???


[02/27/2025 21:28] horus1_007
it's fucking crazy if there is 5 or 10 bugs of this contract it's super clean and security of it it's really solid

[03/14/2025 09:53] infectedfuture
basically you need:
- signal >50%
- signal = valid / invalid (all submitted findings)
- signal is computed once you participated in at least 3 audits and submitted 5 findings
So the strategy is at first to only submit issues you're sure about.
To increase your certainty you can do a PoC, and ensure you correctly assessed the severity (impact/likelihood, see here https://docs.code4rena.com/awarding/judging-criteria/severity-categorization)
and obviously read the contest readme which define the validity scope

so if you have a low signal, meaning there is a high possibility of you finding getting invalid even if they are right?

Hi guys, is there a possibility that my submissions were not reviewed?


[03/18/2025 20:23] ochuko_wh.
Because I can't even find my name in the leaderboard at all


[03/18/2025 20:24] ochuko_wh.
I made 4 submissions 

2 highs and 2 mediums, but I can't find my name in the leaderboard at all


[03/18/2025 20:27] halalauditor
It means they were probably invalidated


[03/18/2025 20:30] ochuko_wh.
Oh, wow


[03/18/2025 20:30] ochuko_wh.
But at least, I expected some feedback


[03/18/2025 20:38] benterkiii
how many valids ??


[03/18/2025 20:38] horus1_007
where is tge feedback or any discuss about the invalid reports???


[03/18/2025 20:38] horus1_007
2 high and 1 medium and that's it.


[03/18/2025 20:38] benterkiii
they will be visible when the report gets published

I just want to clarify 
Are there normally feedbacks in each finding you submit?

hope finding answer about is there is any feedback or discussion about the invalid submission

curious to see the report and how much those 3 vulnerabilities paid


[03/18/2025 20:56] granat__
I have a question, there were 2 highs and 1 medium vulnerabilities in this context, how is possibile that 2 highs and 1 med paid 550$ to some people, 1 high and 1 med paid 346$, 1 high (another high) and 1 med paid 0.35$? 

i think it‚Äôs mathematically wrong, or maybe it‚Äôs just mathematically wrong my mind üòÇ

What you're seeing is a combination of: 
- [Top Gatherer bonus distribution](https://docs.code4rena.com/awarding/incentive-model-and-awards#bonuses-for-top-competitors) (There was no Top Hunter this time because each finding had > 5 submissions.)
- [C4's standard awarding algorithm](https://docs.code4rena.com/awarding/incentive-model-and-awards)
- [Partial credit duplicates](https://docs.code4rena.com/awarding/incentive-model-and-awards#duplicates-getting-partial-credit)

That means not even what is public on code4arena, like ranking and that the code base has a bug?


[03/18/2025 21:08] cloudellie
It's fine to discuss information that is in the award announcement or on the website. I was replying to the warden who asked what the findings were.

@CloudEllie When the submission repo will be public ?


[03/19/2025 02:18] mysteryauditor
I have submitted the issue on _credit() function and think it is valid. But it was invalidated. Could anyone let me know the valid issues?


[03/19/2025 02:18] mysteryauditor
It takes so long to see the report of contest.


[03/19/2025 02:19] mysteryauditor
Should I wait until the report complete?

thats why I got tag notification but cant find my name on it kekw


[03/19/2025 04:04] illoy_sci
It seems like the medium finding got duped to non existence (0$) and one of the high finding duped so much that it's 0.35$ as well ü§£

{Reactions}
üòÇ 

[03/19/2025 04:04] illoy_sci
Then one of the high finding was duped a bit and split among the top 25 ~  worth 346$

{Reactions}
üòÇ 

[03/19/2025 04:05] illoy_sci
finally the people above 346$ are due to gatherer and hunter bonus + selected for report


[03/19/2025 04:05] illoy_sci
This would be my way of making sense of the reward distribution, not sure if it's 100% correct but sure hope it helps

1 high and 1 med == 0.35
I was pretty surprised

I think making the judging transparent to all will reduce these questions

It's because of the number of duplicates. 

The > the dups, the lesser the amount.

@CloudEllie in my profile I see that I have a non-public finding from this contest, yet I cannot find myself in the list, could you check and clarify please?


[04/14/2025 13:39] kartoonjoy
Hi there. There's likely not an issue, this one had a finding that was duped quite significantly so the award was zero'd out. Those names weren't added to the awards listing since no money was being paid.

FYI.....The report will be out later today / tomorrow.

[04/16/2025 08:25] elser17
Correct me if I am wrong: Issue in H-1 is that more TGT tokens than expected (579_000_000) could be deposited into the contract, so users claiming last will get less TITN tokens than they should?
