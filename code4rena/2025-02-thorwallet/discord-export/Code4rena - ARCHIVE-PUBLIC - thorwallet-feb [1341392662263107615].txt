@cryptoxz (Thorwallet) the bridging and withdrawal of TITN. Is this a one time event? Or will this be continously held


[02/20/2025 22:16] cd_pandora
@Matt


[02/20/2025 22:37] cacaomatt
It's intended to be a 1 time event for users. Although they can also do it several times. The goal is that within the 1 year period where the contract will allow merging most TGT holders will go through this process.

Hey!
on the image - it is supposed to be npm install no?

Hi there! That's a c4 question, not a sponsor question. Would you mind removing the tag, please?

I'm linking the RSVP which has the pool breakdown.

@Matt @cryptoxz (Thorwallet)  does the owner is trusted


[02/21/2025 13:31] cryptoxz
Owner of merge contract and deployed of both token is us. Not sure what do you mean here


[02/21/2025 13:32] no.one7777
`onlyOwner`


[02/21/2025 13:33] cryptoxz
I don’t get what you mean by trusted


[02/21/2025 13:34] __serverless
Since they are the owners, yes, it should be trusted.

what does this mean?


[02/21/2025 14:23] cacaomatt (pinned)
There is one trusted role and it’s the owner (deployer)


[02/21/2025 14:27] 0x46_dustin
but that's not in the readme.


[02/21/2025 14:29] 0x46_dustin
wanna explain about it, @kartoonjoy | C4🎇🎇


[02/21/2025 14:44] kartoonjoy
is the ask here that the trusted role be designated as the owner in the README?


[02/21/2025 14:45] 0x46_dustin
trusted role is N/A in the readme.


[02/21/2025 14:46] msk0333
i think that is mistake. the owner should be trusted


[02/21/2025 14:47] unpluggedtj

owner

I think we can assume them to be the owner as the minter is trusted anyways.

am I wrong?


[02/21/2025 18:47] samuselderg
I dont have full context, but skimming the audit repo seems the audit is for the bridge between tokens, so i would expect TGT at least to already exist on mainnet


[02/21/2025 18:53] cacaomatt
These are all test deployments.
The only contract that already exists (for several years now) is TGT


[02/21/2025 18:54] cacaomatt
The audit is for the TITN contracts (including the bridge mechanism) and the Merge contract

@cryptoxz (Thorwallet)  @Matt  how many times can `MergeTgt:: deposit` be called?

1️⃣ 

[02/22/2025 07:40] cacaomatt
As many times as a user want. Every time this happens the user must have some TGT to deposit

🧐 

[02/22/2025 07:41] 4b69
This is the owner function rather


[02/22/2025 07:42] 4b69
The first function in the contract

Can you help?


[02/22/2025 09:23] ochuko_wh.
Please has anyone been able to deploy the Titn contract?

I'm running into some issues here


[02/22/2025 09:43] cacaomatt
Did you try `npx hardhat lz:deploy` > select both base and arbitrum > then type `Titn`


[02/22/2025 10:10] ochuko_wh.
Okay, but is it possible to do the foundry method?


[02/22/2025 10:12] cacaomatt
that's out of scope in this codebase


[02/22/2025 10:12] ochuko_wh.

Yes, If no issues found, all 3 contracts will be redeployed


[02/22/2025 23:01] silver__eth
any idea where to see the staking contract?

i assume its the merge contract but users have no use sending titn tokens there

No it means validators separated issues based on quality and possible duplicates. Now, it turns for sponsor. He confirms/disputes to issues with his arguments. Later, judge will make the final decision.

win a contest or multiple win with top 5 of contest and you will be able to participate, I guess

[03/14/2025 08:11] 0xhelium
You can win 100 contest but your signal Will still be low

[03/14/2025 09:53] infectedfuture
basically you need:
- signal >50%
- signal = valid / invalid (all submitted findings)
- signal is computed once you participated in at least 3 audits and submitted 5 findings
So the strategy is at first to only submit issues you're sure about.
To increase your certainty you can do a PoC, and ensure you correctly assessed the severity (impact/likelihood, see here https://docs.code4rena.com/awarding/judging-criteria/severity-categorization)
and obviously read the contest readme which define the validity scope

[03/14/2025 09:56] cloudellie
The current status of the audit is shown on the website. We mainly post updates when awards are announced. Until then it’s difficult to predict the dates, since they depend on deep analysis of all of the submissions.


[03/14/2025 09:57] horus1_007
thank you for answering 
literary no one have been answering us


[03/14/2025 09:57] cloudellie
Well, we get about a hundred “when???” posts a day and we’re a small team. 😊

so what do you do then?


[03/14/2025 12:36] mylifechangefast.eth_70767
so if you have a low signal, meaning there is a high possibility of you finding getting invalid even if they are right?


[03/14/2025 14:50] mysteryauditor
I  think this contest involves a few bugs and will be finnished in short time. But it takse long time.

Hi guys, is there a possibility that my submissions were not reviewed?


[03/18/2025 20:23] ochuko_wh.
Because I can't even find my name in the leaderboard at all


[03/18/2025 20:24] ochuko_wh.
I made 4 submissions 

2 highs and 2 mediums, but I can't find my name in the leaderboard at all


[03/18/2025 20:27] halalauditor
It means they were probably invalidated


[03/18/2025 20:30] ochuko_wh.
Oh, wow


[03/18/2025 20:30] ochuko_wh.
But at least, I expected some feedback


[03/18/2025 20:38] benterkiii
how many valids ??


[03/18/2025 20:38] horus1_007
where is tge feedback or any discuss about the invalid reports???


[03/18/2025 20:38] horus1_007
2 high and 1 medium and that's it.


[03/18/2025 20:38] benterkiii
they will be visible when the report gets published


[03/18/2025 20:38] horus1_007

My first contest here

I just want to clarify 
Are there normally feedbacks in each finding you submit?


[03/18/2025 20:39] horus1_007
hope finding answer about is there is any feedback or discussion about the invalid submission


[03/18/2025 20:43] benterkiii

[03/18/2025 20:47] granat__
curious to see the report and how much those 3 vulnerabilities paid


[03/18/2025 20:56] granat__
I have a question, there were 2 highs and 1 medium vulnerabilities in this context, how is possibile that 2 highs and 1 med paid 550$ to some people, 1 high and 1 med paid 346$, 1 high (another high) and 1 med paid 0.35$? 

i think it’s mathematically wrong, or maybe it’s just mathematically wrong my mind 😂

What you're seeing is a combination of: 
- [Top Gatherer bonus distribution](https://docs.code4rena.com/awarding/incentive-model-and-awards#bonuses-for-top-competitors) (There was no Top Hunter this time because each finding had > 5 submissions.)
- [C4's standard awarding algorithm](https://docs.code4rena.com/awarding/incentive-model-and-awards)
- [Partial credit duplicates](https://docs.code4rena.com/awarding/incentive-model-and-awards#duplicates-getting-partial-credit)

That means not even what is public on code4arena, like ranking and that the code base has a bug?


[03/18/2025 21:08] cloudellie
It's fine to discuss information that is in the award announcement or on the website. I was replying to the warden who asked what the findings were.

@CloudEllie When the submission repo will be public ?


[03/19/2025 02:18] mysteryauditor
I have submitted the issue on _credit() function and think it is valid. But it was invalidated. Could anyone let me know the valid issues?


[03/19/2025 02:18] mysteryauditor
It takes so long to see the report of contest.


[03/19/2025 02:19] mysteryauditor
Should I wait until the report complete?


[03/19/2025 03:43] saurabh_0312
i didnt understand the reward distributuion


[03/19/2025 04:00] _bzee.
lol


[03/19/2025 04:02] dot_cloud
thats why I got tag notification but cant find my name on it kekw


[03/19/2025 04:04] illoy_sci
It seems like the medium finding got duped to non existence (0$) and one of the high finding duped so much that it's 0.35$ as well 🤣

{Reactions}
😂 

[03/19/2025 04:04] illoy_sci
Then one of the high finding was duped a bit and split among the top 25 ~  worth 346$

{Reactions}
😂 

[03/19/2025 04:05] illoy_sci
finally the people above 346$ are due to gatherer and hunter bonus + selected for report


[03/19/2025 04:05] illoy_sci
This would be my way of making sense of the reward distribution, not sure if it's 100% correct but sure hope it helps


[03/19/2025 04:08] daniel526
Hello @CloudEllie does this result lead to an immediate effect on signal score? cc: @thebrittfactor | C4

[03/19/2025 12:51] _bzee.
So 2 med == 0.35🤔


[03/19/2025 21:06] benterkiii
1 high and 1 med == 0.35
I was pretty surprised


[03/19/2025 22:14] dharkartz_24419
I think making the judging transparent to all will reduce these questions

[03/20/2025 10:29] aarif02
It's because of the number of duplicates. 

The > the dups, the lesser the amount.

[03/24/2025 22:45] ykuio
I can see in the website that I missed a high


[03/24/2025 22:46] ykuio
Weird because I reported two highs


[04/14/2025 13:35] elser17
@CloudEllie in my profile I see that I have a non-public finding from this contest, yet I cannot find myself in the list, could you check and clarify please?


[04/14/2025 13:39] kartoonjoy
Hi there. There's likely not an issue, this one had a finding that was duped quite significantly so the award was zero'd out. Those names weren't added to the awards listing since no money was being paid.

FYI.....The report will be out later today / tomorrow.

[04/16/2025 08:25] elser17
Correct me if I am wrong: Issue in H-1 is that more TGT tokens than expected (579_000_000) could be deposited into the contract, so users claiming last will get less TITN tokens than they should?
